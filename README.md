# configs

Configs for my Unix experience, by theme.

In case you want to make symlinks, the `link_maker.py` script automatically
makes some of them.

**WARNING:** Some configurations depend on the environment. For example, [my `vimrc`](editor/vim/vimrc)
uses [`minpac`](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac) as package manager. This depends on having
the source tree of `minpac` in the appropriate place. Sometimes I look for a more robust
configuration code. However this is not alway possible, or I simply don't have the
knowledge. It may be helpful to clone the repo with `--recurse-submodules`.
